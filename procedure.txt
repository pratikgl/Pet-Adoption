The script file is final_model.py
The output file is lola.csv

Step 1:
the first step was converting the NaN values of 'condition' column to 3.

Step 2:
hot encoding the columns 'Condition' and 'color_type'

step 3:
imputation for column 'X1'. The imputation method used is mean by target 
where the target variable was 'X2'

step 4:
Feature Selection -> selectKbest python function was used for feature selection 
where k was 64, 50 respectively for 'breed_category' and 'pet_category'

step 5:
gradient boosting classifier was used for training the model

step 6:
the same preprocessing step was done for the test data and after preprocessing,
they were fitted in the model to predict the variables viz: 'breed_category' and 'pet_category'

step 7:
the output was converted to a dataframe and then to a csv file
